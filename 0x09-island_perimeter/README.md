0x09-island_perimeter

This project involves creation of a function that will calculate the perimeter of an Island using a 2D-grid.
The grid is a rectangular list of lists with: - '0' representing water and '1' representing land.

The Island perimeter shall be determined by the edges of the land cells 

Concepts Needed:

2D Arrays (Matrices):

Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

Conditional Logic:

Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

Counting Techniques:

Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.
Problem-Solving Strategies:

Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

Python Programming:

Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
